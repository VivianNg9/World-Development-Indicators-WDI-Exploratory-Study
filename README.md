# __<center>World Development Indicators (WDI) Exploratory Study</center>__
The "World Development Indicators" dataset was examined and analyzed by the researchers using Microsoft Excel and SAS Visual Analytics to generate insights on factors contributing to economic performance and elements in monetary policy indicated by GDPperCapita and Developed as Global North/South is found to be too simplistic and inconclusive to divide the economy geographically.

## Tools 
- **Programming & Analytics Tools**: Microsoft Excel, SAS Visual Analytics (SAS Viya).
- **Statistical Methods**: Descriptive analytics, correlation analysis, multilinear regression, logistic regression, forecasting models.
- **Data Sources**: [World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset.](https://github.com/VivianNg9/World-Development-Indicators-WDI-Exploratory-Study/blob/main/WDI%20data%20final.csv)

## Objectives
1. Analyze economic trends across 20 countries over 50 years.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the Global North/South classification.
3. Identify key predictors of GDP per capita growth.
4. Examine monetary policies and their impact on economic performance.
5. Forecast GDP per capita growth trends using econometric models.

## Analytical Methods

### 1. Descriptive Analytics 
#### 1.1. Variable Overview

Several key variables in the dataset had missing data, raising concerns about their representativeness in predicting GDP per capita growth and economic development. Notably, electricity consumption data has been absent since 2015 despite its strong correlation with GDP, and health expenditure per capita was not recorded until 2000. Additionally, land area remained constant over time, while inflation exhibited significant fluctuations between 1989 and 1994.


### Explanatory Analysis
- **Correlation Matrix**: Identified key economic relationships.
- **Multilinear Regression**: Explored GDP per capita determinants.
- **Logistic Regression**: Predicted whether a country is developed based on economic indicators.

### Forecasting Model
- **GDP per Capita Trend Analysis**: Identified cyclical economic patterns.
- **ARIMA Model**: Forecasted GDP per capita growth over three years.
- **Goal-Seeking Analysis**: Determined required health expenditure to achieve a 10% increase in GDP per capita.

## Key Findings

### Economic Classification
- The Global North/South division is outdated.
- The Human Development Index (HDI)-based classification is more relevant.

### GDP and Economic Growth
- Health expenditure is the strongest predictor of GDP per capita growth.
- Higher agricultural land use correlates negatively with GDP per capita.
- Developed countries rely more on value-added services and taxation.

### Monetary Policy and Financial Stability
- Developed countries maintain stable deposit and interest rates aligned with inflation.
- Developing countries show more volatility in financial policies.

### Labor and Employment
- Developed countries have a higher proportion of stable employment.
- Laborers in developed nations generate 7 times more wealth than those in developing nations.

### Forecasting and Policy Recommendations
- Increasing health expenditure leads to economic growth.
- To achieve a 10% increase in GDP per capita, health expenditure must rise proportionally.
- Policymakers should focus on shifting economic dependency away from agriculture in developing nations.

## Conclusion
This study provides insights into economic growth patterns and the significance of health expenditure in GDP per capita trends. It also emphasizes the need for additional data collection on foreign direct investment, tax policies, and population demographics for future analysis. The findings can inform policy decisions on sustainable economic development and monetary policy improvements.
